BOUNDA ASSURANCE offers its customers four categories of fares identifiable by a colour: blue, green, orange and red.
The fare depends on the driver's situation:

-A driver under the age of 26 who has been licensed for less than three years is awarded the red fare
, if he has never been responsible for an accident. Otherwise, the company refuses to insure it.

-Drivers under the age of 26 and holders of the licence for more than two years,
 or over the age of 25 but holders of the licence for less than three years,
are entitled to the orange fare if they have never caused an accident, to the red fare for an accident,
otherwise they are refused.

-A driver over the age of 25 who has had a licence for more than two years receives the green tariff
if he is not the cause of an accident and the orange tariff for one accident, the red tariff for two
accidents and refused afterwards.

In addition, to encourage the loyalty of accepted customers, the company offers an immediately most
advantageous color contract if it has been in the house for more than five years. Thus, if it meets
this requirement, a normally "green" customer becomes "blue," a normally "orange" customer becomes "green,"
and "red" customer becomes orange.

Write the algorithm for entering the necessary data (with input control), determining the correct fare,
a database, an option to see if data have been entered correctly and ability to change them.
